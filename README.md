## Installation

Check Enonic Market for further details on installing apps in XP. You have multiple options. The easiest way is to just go to the Application admin tool inside Enonic XP and hit the "Install" button, now find this app and click "Install". Done!

To build the source manually, just download this repo (or use the [XP Toolbox "init-project"](http://xp.readthedocs.io/en/6.5/developer/projects/init.html)), and use the command ["gradlew deploy"](http://xp.readthedocs.io/en/6.5/developer/projects/build.html) in the terminal.
